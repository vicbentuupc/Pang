We have implemented the game in a way that closely resembles the original, with the three base levels shown in the statement, each with corresponding balls and backgrounds.

Before going to any level, we encounter a world map where we can select among three cities that represent the available levels, and access to a tutorial screen and a credits screen is also possible.

In the game, there are a number of lives per phase, but as our levels are independent, we have decided to give 3 lives to overcome each one, although death only means having to select the level again.

The balls bounce in a way that is as similar as possible, although they do not follow exactly the same parabola. They explode in the same way with the corresponding animation and have the 4 levels that apply.

As for the power-ups, we have implemented the double hook, dynamite, and the one that paralyzes the balls for a while.

Food falls randomly from the sky. Although the statement seems to indicate that it should be generated when bubbles burst, in the original game it falls from the sky randomly, so we have decided to do it this way.

For points, 500 points are added for bursting a crystal platform and 100 for grabbing a power-up. The scoring of the bubbles is the same as in the original, with base scores of 50, 100, 150, and 200 for each ball, and if we burst more than one of the same type in a row, we have multipliers of x2, x4, and x8. We have implemented 6 different types of food, each with the corresponding score, with the less valuable ones having a higher chance of appearing.

Lastly, basic actions like climbing stairs, moving, and bursting glass platforms can be performed, each with its corresponding animation.

Instructions:

To move, use the arrow keys and to shoot the hook, use the space bar.

With the 'T' key, we make it so you can only shoot one hook at a time, with 'Y' we grab the double hook power-up, 'U' for the dynamite, and 'I' to stop the balls.
